### Getting Started with CoreFX
Overall information for working on the project can be found [here](https://diaryofadev.net/getting-started-contributing-to-corefx/).

### Install CMake
1. [Download the binary distribution](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. Add Cmake to your Path (In environment variables add C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 3.13\bin\)
3. To test if it is on your path open command prompt and type cmake. If you get "cmake is not recognized as an internal or external command" it didn't work.

### Install Git if not already installed
1. [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install git
3. Check if you have git bash or git on the command line. If on the command line type git. If you get "git is not recognized as an internal or external command" it didn't work.
